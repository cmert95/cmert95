## 🫵 Welcome to my profile!

- 🏋️‍♂️💻🍔 If I had to describe myself in three words: `sports`, `computers`, and `food`.  

- 🍽️😂 I eat like crazy — but stay away from sugar! 🚫🍭  

- 🏃‍♂️💪 Since 2013, I’ve been working out every single day.


## 🫡 And yes... Technology!

- 🤓❤️ If you're here, you're probably a computer enthusiast too — just like me!

- ⚡ Thanks to my background in electrical engineering, I'm passionate about both software and hardware.

- 🖥️🔧 I love collecting second-hand computer parts and using them in my projects.

 🚀🔥The moment when I overclocked my CPU by 20% and still managed to fully utilize all CPU cores in Spark...  **Now THAT’s a dream come true, right?!** 😍

## ✨ A Fresh Start!

- 🎯 This is actually my second GitHub profile!  
(The first one got a bit too messy for my perfectionist standards 😅)

- 🛠️📦 I'm slowly moving my projects here while organizing everything better.

- 💼🔎 At the same time, I'm actively looking for a job — and even if I can't do it all at once, I'm determined to keep moving forward! 🚀😄💪

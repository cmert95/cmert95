## 🫵 Welcome to my profile!

- 🏋️‍♂️ If I had to describe myself in three words: `sports`, `food`, and `computers`.  

- 🤓 If you're here, you're probably a computer enthusiast too — just like me!

- ⚡ Coming from an electronic engineering background, I enjoy bridging software and hardware — often through DIY projects using second-hand components.

 🚀🔥The moment when I overclocked my CPU by 20% and still managed to fully utilize all CPU cores in Spark...  **Now THAT’s a dream come true, right?!** 😍

## 💼 What I Do Here

Honestly? I pretty much just do whatever I feel like.

- ⚡ Sometimes I collect, clean, and generate datasets for fun or practice.
- 🚀 Sometimes I write small scripts for Raspberry Pi and turn them into 24/7-running systems.
- 🛠️ Sometimes I revisit and improve the projects I built during my student years.
- 🧰 Sometimes I dive into DevOps — automating things and managing CI/CD pipelines.

I’m a bit of a perfectionist — I can’t help but care deeply about structure, clarity, and making things feel “just right.”

## 🌱 Currently Working On

- 🔎 Migrating my best work to this new GitHub account.
- 🎧 Developing a character analysis tool for Discord.
- 💼 Looking for opportunities where I can grow, build, and contribute.
